    Ruxandra has shown tremendous growth and aptitude for picking up new topics, learning new skills and taking on large and complex architectural challenges, from helping her team by taking a leadership role through pairing and sharing best practices, into becoming part of the Architecture and Platform team, to help set standards and build developer acceleration tools for a team of 400+ technologists working in a rapid digital transformation environment!

    Ruxandra is the ideal technical team leader in having the passion and energy to build and improve technology and people and balancing that with thoughtful and deep understanding of her teammates and the business needs.

    I would welcome and look forward to the opportunity to work with Ruxandra again in the future!

    In each and every case when I have worked with Ruxandra, she has impressed me with the depth and breadth of skill that she has demonstrated. I have found her to be uniquely determined to deliver a high quality of product, and keenly insightful in finding ways to eliminate technical debt and improve her personal and professional performance.

    I would recommend Ruxandra for any team, as her knowledge, skills and experience make her a tremendous contributor and a powerful asset.

    Ruxandra is a force to be reckoned with.

    During our time together at TELUS Digital, we worked on a variety of challenging e-commerce and online account management experiences. Most notably, we brought to life an E2E digital experience that enabled TELUS customers the ability to change their internet rate plan online without having to call into the call centre/physically visit a retail store. At the time this was shipped, it was the first of its kind!

    As a fullstack software engineer, Ruxandra possesses a very strong technical acumen and is able to navigate both front end and backend technologies with ease. She has a unique ability to balance the technical requirements of a long term product vision and the immediate needs to ship value to customers iteratively.

    In the time that we worked together, I could always rely on her to get me up-skilled with the technical challenges of the apps we were building. Her ability to communicate complex technical limitations in a very succinct manner made making trade offs easy.

    Overall, Ruxandra is an absolute joy and pleasure to work with. You can’t really ask for much more. But if you do, know that she will exceed all your expectations and then some.

    I have had the privilege of working with Ruxandra for 4 years now and I can honestly say I take tremendous pride in writing this recommendation. I remember the first meeting we had together, I knew instantly she was going to do amazing things and help our team rise to new levels. Her interest in the team, our goals, how she could help, and immediate contributions were beyond impressive.
    
    Ruxandra's passion, commitment, willingness to try, learn and teach are unsurpassed. She is a strategic thinker and drives the team to find the right solution, recommends alternate options and rallies the team to get things done. She has the trust and respect of her team mates and the leadership team. Ruxandra is truly an amazing addition to any team

    Working with Ruxandra for the last 3+ years has been a highlight for me. When she first joined my team, working on My TELUS (customer self serve), I knew she was special. 
    
    Ruxandra has an innate capacity to learn... she's a sponge! She quickly ramped up on all of our tooling, and was punching well above her weight for a new hire. Since then I have seen her career skyrocket, as she quickly ramped from her next role as team lead into her current role as one of the most influential architects in the company. 
    
    Her amazing technical abilities is only a small part of the full package. Beyond that, she demonstrates keen soft skills, strong business sense, and is an amazing leader, mentor and entrepreneur in her own right. Ruxandra brings her good humour, humility, empathy and PMA into any circumstance, which makes her an excellent facilitator, and a powerful developer advocate. 
    
    Given more time, I am convinced she will be an absolute juggernaut in the local development scene!

    Ruxandra has been, hands down, one of my favourite teammates that I ever had the opportunity to work with. As a designer, I have always been impressed with her ability to work seamlessly with designers and POs. She is able to contextualize tech challenges to team members who don't have a background in software engineering and her attention to detail makes it a breeze to work on solutions together.

    I am continuously impressed with her ability to lead and work with a team strongly. She is passionate, kind, funny and working with her feels like working with a friend.

    Ruxandra has my highest recommendation and my only regret is that we don't work together anymore!

    Ruxandra and I worked closely to manage an array of responsibilities. She is always looking to learn and is a dedicated teammate who is always putting others first. I feel very fortunate to have had the chance to work with her, she brought a great deal of talent and positive culture to the team. I hope we have the chance to work together again!
