She quickly ramped up on all of our tooling, and was punching well above her weight for a new hire. Since then I have seen her career skyrocket, as she quickly ramped from her next role as team lead into her current role as one of the most influential architects in the company. \n\nHer amazing technical abilities is only a small part of the full package.
